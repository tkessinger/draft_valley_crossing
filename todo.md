# Things to do on this project

## General to do

- Replicate Weissman et al. (2010) results for Figures 3 and 4
- Create parameter set with fitness variance to add draft to valley crossing
- Run simulations with above parameters and analyze results
- Derive analytical expectations of expected valley crossing time with fitness variance
	- expectations for Weissman results
	- expectations for draft results
- Write up analytical results
- Write up simulations results

## Evoltuion 2017 talk ##

- Select analytical and simulation results to present
- Draft background
- Draft results
- Practice draft talk
